# DC_DC_Buck_Converter
This project showcases a DC-DC buck converter (step-down converter) designed using KiCad PCB design software. The buck converter efficiently converts a higher DC input voltage to a lower DC output voltage, making it ideal for powering circuits that require lower voltage from a single supply source.

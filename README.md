# DC_DC_Buck_Converter
This project showcases a DC-DC buck converter (step-down converter) designed using KiCad PCB design software. The buck converter efficiently converts a higher DC input voltage to a lower DC output voltage, making it ideal for powering circuits that require lower voltage from a single supply source. The converter uses the TPS561201 IC with selected inductors and capacitors for efficient switching, providing stable voltage with low ripple and supporting up to 1A load current.

# Components

- TPS561201 DC-DC Buck Converter Controller IC
- Inductor (L1)
- Input Capacitor (C1) – 22 μF ceramic capacitor
- Bootstrap Capacitor (C2) – 0.1 μF ceramic capacitor
- Feedback Resistors (R1, R2) – For output voltage regulation
- Connector J1 – Input power connector
- Connector J2 – Output power connector
- PCB with optimized wide current traces and SMD components for assembly

These parts work together to enable efficient step-down voltage regulation with stable, low-ripple output supporting up to 1A load current as designed in your KiCad project.
